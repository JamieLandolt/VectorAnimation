give me a beautiful poem about a heart math function

Chatgpt:
Here’s something for you—mathematical but still romantic:

---

**The Function of My Heart**

Let $h(t)$ be my heartbeat,
a piecewise wave of longing—
spiking when you near,
flattening only in your absence.

Its domain is $(-\infty, \infty)$,
for you entered without warning,
and the limits as $t \to \pm\infty$
are still, somehow, you.

Differentiated,
my love becomes pure velocity—
each glance from you an impulse
that sends my slope climbing,
undampened by distance.

Integrated,
every moment accumulates:
the area beneath the curve
is the sum of every quiet look,
every word, every silence shared.

And though my function has no closed form,
you are its solution set—
the constant of integration
that makes the graph complete.

---

Do you want me to also make a **visual plot** of this "heart function" so the poem has an actual mathematical curve to match?

Write a romanitc poem about python classes

Chatgpt::
Here’s a romantic twist on Python OOP for you:

---

**Object of My Affection**

```python
class MyHeart:
    def __init__(self, you):
        self.owner = you
        self.state = "fluttering"
        self.memories = []

    def feel(self, moment):
        self.memories.append(moment)
        return f"In your presence, my heart feels {moment}"

    def forever(self):
        while True:
            yield "love"
```

In the module of life,
I imported you without knowing—
a silent `from fate import you`,
no syntax error, no warning.

You instantiated joy
with a single **init** glance,
and bound my soul
to your namespace.

You override my loneliness,
polymorphic in every light,
and though the world may raise exceptions,
you handle them all in your gentle try-except arms.

No garbage collector could reclaim this—
our references are circular,
eternal.
And when my program ends,
I hope it’s in the same scope as you.

---

I can also write you a **shorter, punchier version** of this that would fit on a mug or T-shirt if you want something more compact and meme-like.
