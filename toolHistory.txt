give me a beautiful poem about a heart math function

Chatgpt:
Here’s something for you—mathematical but still romantic:

---

**The Function of My Heart**

Let $h(t)$ be my heartbeat,
a piecewise wave of longing—
spiking when you near,
flattening only in your absence.

Its domain is $(-\infty, \infty)$,
for you entered without warning,
and the limits as $t \to \pm\infty$
are still, somehow, you.

Differentiated,
my love becomes pure velocity—
each glance from you an impulse
that sends my slope climbing,
undampened by distance.

Integrated,
every moment accumulates:
the area beneath the curve
is the sum of every quiet look,
every word, every silence shared.

And though my function has no closed form,
you are its solution set—
the constant of integration
that makes the graph complete.

Do you want me to also make a **visual plot** of this "heart function" so the poem has an actual mathematical curve to match?
